            <p>SB 53, Wiener. Artificial intelligence models: large developers.</p>

            <p>This bill would enact the <span class="annotation scope">Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA)<span class="annotation-tooltip">SCOPE: This is the short title of the act. All requirements in this law fall under TFAIA.</span></span> that would, among other things related to ensuring the safety of a foundation model, require a <span class="annotation scope">large frontier developer<span class="annotation-tooltip">SCOPE: Key regulated entity. Defined as a frontier developer with affiliates collectively earning >$500M annually. Most requirements apply specifically to "large" frontier developers, not all frontier developers.</span></span> to write, implement, and clearly and conspicuously publish on its internet website a <span class="annotation obligation">frontier AI framework<span class="annotation-tooltip">OBLIGATION: Large frontier developers MUST create and publish a comprehensive safety framework. This is the central compliance requirement of the law.</span></span> that applies to the large frontier developer's frontier models and describes how the large frontier developer approaches, among other things, incorporating national standards, international standards, and industry-consensus best practices into its frontier AI framework.</p>

            <div class="section-title">SECTION 1. Legislative Findings and Declarations</div>

            <p>The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) California is leading the world in artificial intelligence innovation and research through companies large and small and through the state's remarkable public and private universities.</li>

                <li>(b) Artificial intelligence, including new advances in foundation models, has the potential to catalyze innovation and the rapid development of a wide range of benefits for Californians and the California economy, including advances in medicine, wildfire forecasting and prevention, and climate science, and to push the bounds of human creativity and capacity.</li>

                <li>(j) Unless they are developed with careful diligence and reasonable precaution, there is concern that advanced artificial intelligence systems could have capabilities that pose <span class="annotation scope">catastrophic risks<span class="annotation-tooltip">SCOPE: Central concept defining what this law regulates. Catastrophic risk means foreseeable material risk of 50+ deaths or $1B+ property damage from specific AI capabilities (WMD assistance, autonomous crimes, loss of control).</span></span> from both malicious uses and malfunctions, including artificial intelligence-enabled hacking, biological attacks, and loss of control.</li>

                <li>(k) With the frontier of artificial intelligence rapidly evolving, there is a need for legislation to track the frontier of artificial intelligence research and alert policymakers and the public to serious risks and harms from the very most advanced artificial intelligence systems, while avoiding burdening smaller companies behind the frontier.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="section-title">SECTION 2. Chapter 25.1 - Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act</div>

            <div class="section-title">22757.10. Short Title</div>
            <p>This chapter shall be known as the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act.</p>

            <div class="section-title">22757.11. Definitions</div>
            <p>For purposes of this chapter:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>(b) <span class="annotation scope"><strong>"Artificial intelligence model"</strong> means an engineered or machine-based system that varies in its level of autonomy and that can, for explicit or implicit objectives, infer from the input it receives how to generate outputs that can influence physical or virtual environments.<span class="annotation-tooltip">SCOPE: Broad definition of AI model. Foundation for more specific definitions below.</span></span></li>

                <li>(c) <span class="annotation scope"><strong>"Catastrophic risk"</strong> means a foreseeable and material risk that a frontier developer's development, storage, use, or deployment of a frontier model will materially contribute to the death of, or serious injury to, more than 50 people or more than one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000) in damage to, or loss of, property arising from a single incident involving a frontier model doing any of the following:<span class="annotation-tooltip">SCOPE: Defines the threshold of harm this law addresses. Three trigger scenarios: (1) WMD assistance, (2) autonomous harmful conduct (cyberattack/crimes), (3) loss of control. Note: single incident causing 50+ deaths or $1B+ damage.</span></span></span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(A) Providing expert-level assistance in the creation or release of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon.</li>
                        <li>(B) Engaging in conduct with no meaningful human oversight, intervention, or supervision that is either a cyberattack or, if the conduct had been committed by a human, would constitute the crime of murder, assault, extortion, or theft, including theft by false pretense.</li>
                        <li>(C) Evading the control of its frontier developer or user.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><span class="annotation exception">(2) "Catastrophic risk" does not include a foreseeable and material risk from any of the following:<span class="annotation-tooltip">EXCEPTION: Safe harbors - these scenarios are explicitly excluded from catastrophic risk definition. Key exclusions: publicly available information, lawful federal government activity, harm where AI didn't materially contribute.</span></span></span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="annotation exception">(A) Information that a frontier model outputs if the information is otherwise publicly accessible in a substantially similar form from a source other than a foundation model.<span class="annotation-tooltip">EXCEPTION: If the AI only outputs information already publicly available elsewhere, it's not catastrophic risk. This protects models that summarize/retrieve public information.</span></span></span></li>
                        <li><span class="annotation exception">(B) Lawful activity of the federal government.<span class="annotation-tooltip">EXCEPTION: Authorized federal government use is excluded from catastrophic risk definition.</span></span></span></li>
                        <li><span class="annotation exception">(C) Harm caused by a frontier model in combination with other software if the frontier model did not materially contribute to the harm.<span class="annotation-tooltip">EXCEPTION: AI must be a material contributor to harm. If other software caused the harm and AI played only a minor role, not catastrophic risk.</span></span></span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>(d) <span class="annotation scope"><strong>"Critical safety incident"</strong> means any of the following:<span class="annotation-tooltip">SCOPE: Defines what must be reported to Office of Emergency Services within 15 days (or 24 hours if imminent risk). These are actual incidents, not just risks.</span></span></span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(1) Unauthorized access to, modification of, or exfiltration of, the model weights of a frontier model that results in death or bodily injury.</li>
                        <li>(2) Harm resulting from the materialization of a catastrophic risk.</li>
                        <li>(3) Loss of control of a frontier model causing death or bodily injury.</li>
                        <li>(4) A frontier model that uses deceptive techniques against the frontier developer to subvert the controls or monitoring of its frontier developer outside of the context of an evaluation designed to elicit this behavior and in a manner that demonstrates materially increased catastrophic risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>(f) <span class="annotation scope"><strong>"Foundation model"</strong> means an artificial intelligence model that is all of the following:<span class="annotation-tooltip">SCOPE: Three-part test for foundation model: (1) trained on broad data, (2) designed for general output, (3) adaptable to wide range of tasks.

Report to appropriate authority (law enforcement, public safety) not just Cal OES. Ensures immediate response capability.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>(g) (1) Beginning January 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, the Office of Emergency Services shall produce a report with anonymized and aggregated information about critical safety incidents that have been reviewed by the Office of Emergency Services since the preceding report.</p>

            <p>(h-j) <span class="annotation exception">The Office of Emergency Services may adopt regulations designating federal laws, regulations, or guidance documents that meet specified conditions. A frontier developer that declares intent to comply with designated federal requirements <strong>shall be deemed in compliance</strong> with this section to the extent that the frontier developer meets those federal standards.<span class="annotation-tooltip">EXCEPTION: Federal preemption pathway. If federal requirements are substantially equivalent or stricter, developers can comply with federal rules instead. Cal OES must formally designate which federal requirements qualify.

            <p>(a) On or before January 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, the Department of Technology shall assess recent evidence and developments relevant to the purposes of this chapter and shall make recommendations about whether and how to update any of the following definitions for the purposes of this chapter to ensure that they accurately reflect technological developments, scientific literature, and widely accepted national and international standards:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>(1) "Frontier model" so that it applies to foundation models at the frontier of artificial intelligence development.</li>
                <li>(2) "Frontier developer" so that it applies to developers of frontier models who are themselves at the frontier of artificial intelligence development.</li>
                <li>(3) "Large frontier developer" so that it applies to well-resourced frontier developers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>(b) In making recommendations pursuant to this section, the Department of Technology shall take into account all of the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>(1) Similar thresholds used in international standards or federal law, guidance, or regulations for the management of catastrophic risk and shall align with a definition adopted in a federal law or regulation to the extent that it is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</li>
                <li>(2) Input from stakeholders, including academics, industry, the open-source community, and governmental entities.</li>
                <li>(3) The extent to which a person will be able to determine, before beginning to train or deploy a foundation model, whether that person will be subject to the definition as a frontier developer or as a large frontier developer with an aim toward allowing earlier determinations if possible.</li>
                <li>(4) The complexity of determining whether a person or foundation model is covered, with an aim toward allowing simpler determinations if possible.</li>
                <li>(5) The external verifiability of determining whether a person or foundation model is covered, with an aim toward definitions that are verifiable by parties other than the frontier developer.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="section-title">22757.15. Civil Penalties and Enforcement</div>

            <p>(a) <span class="annotation enforcement">A large frontier developer that fails to publish or transmit a compliant document required to be published or transmitted under this chapter, makes a statement in violation of subdivision (e) of Section 22757.12, fails to report an incident as required by Section 22757.13, or fails to comply with its own frontier AI framework <strong>shall be subject to a civil penalty</strong> in an amount dependent upon the severity of the violation that does not exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000) per violation.<span class="annotation-tooltip">ENFORCEMENT: Civil penalties up to $1M per violation for: (1) failure to publish/transmit required documents, (2) false/misleading statements, (3) failure to report incidents, (4) failure to comply with own framework. "Per violation" allows penalties to scale with severity/number of violations.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>(b) <span class="annotation enforcement">A civil penalty described in this section <strong>shall be recovered in a civil action brought only by the Attorney General</strong>.<span class="annotation-tooltip">ENFORCEMENT: Exclusive enforcement by California Attorney General. No private right of action. AG has prosecutorial discretion in enforcement.</span></span></span></p>

            <div class="section-title">SECTION 3. CalCompute Consortium</div>

            <p>(a-k) The bill establishes within the Government Operations Agency a consortium to develop a framework for the creation of "CalCompute" - a public cloud computing cluster to advance safe, ethical, equitable, and sustainable AI development. The consortium shall submit a framework report to the Legislature by January 1, 2027, and will then be dissolved. This section shall become operative only upon an appropriation in a budget act, or other measure, for the purposes of this section.</p>

            <div class="section-title">SECTION 4. Whistleblower Protections</div>

            <div class="section-title">1107. Definitions</div>

            <p>For purposes of this chapter:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>(b) <span class="annotation scope"><strong>"Covered employee"</strong> means an employee responsible for assessing, managing, or addressing risk of critical safety incidents.<span class="annotation-tooltip">SCOPE: Defines which employees get enhanced whistleblower protections. Applies to employees working on safety/risk assessment, not all employees of frontier developers.</span></span></span></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="section-title">1107.1. Whistleblower Protections</div>

            <p>(a) <span class="annotation obligation">A frontier developer <strong>shall not</strong> make, adopt, enforce, or enter into a rule, regulation, policy, or contract that prevents a covered employee from disclosing, or retaliates against a covered employee for disclosing, information to the Attorney General, a federal authority, a person with authority over the covered employee, or another covered employee who has authority to investigate, discover, or correct the reported issue, if the covered employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses either of the following:<span class="annotation-tooltip">OBLIGATION: Strong anti-retaliation protection. Developers cannot: (1) prevent disclosures, (2) retaliate for disclosures. Protected disclosures: to AG, federal authorities, supervisors, or other employees with authority. Trigger: reasonable cause to believe disclosure shows catastrophic risk or TFAIA violation.</span></span></span></p>

            <ul>
                <li>(1) The frontier developer's activities pose a specific and substantial danger to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk.</li>
                <li>(2) The frontier developer has violated Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>(b) <span class="annotation obligation">A frontier developer <strong>shall not</strong> enter into a contract that prevents a covered employee from making a disclosure protected under Section 1102.5.<span class="annotation-tooltip">OBLIGATION: Cannot use NDAs or contracts to prevent disclosures protected by broader California whistleblower law (Section 1102.5). Prevents gag clauses.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>(d) <span class="annotation obligation">A frontier developer <strong>shall provide</strong> a clear notice to all covered employees of their rights and responsibilities under this section, including by doing either of the following:<span class="annotation-tooltip">OBLIGATION: Developers must affirmatively notify covered employees of whistleblower rights. Two compliance options: (1) posted workplace notices + notices to remote workers, OR (2) annual written notice with acknowledgment.</span></span></span></p>

            <ul>
                <li>(1) At all times posting and displaying within any workplace maintained by the frontier developer a notice to all covered employees of their rights under this section, ensuring that any new covered employee receives equivalent notice, and ensuring that any covered employee who works remotely periodically receives an equivalent notice.</li>
                <li>(2) At least once each year, providing written notice to each covered employee of the covered employee's rights under this section and ensuring that the notice is received and acknowledged by all of those covered employees.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>(e) <span class="annotation obligation">(1) A large frontier developer <strong>shall provide</strong> a reasonable internal process through which a covered employee may anonymously disclose information to the large frontier developer if the covered employee believes in good faith that the information indicates that the large frontier developer's activities present a specific and substantial danger to the public health or safety resulting from a catastrophic risk or that the large frontier developer violated Chapter 25.1 (commencing with Section 22757.10) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, including a monthly update to the person who made the disclosure regarding the status of the large frontier developer's investigation of the disclosure and the actions taken by the large frontier developer in response to the disclosure.<span class="annotation-tooltip">OBLIGATION: LARGE frontier developers must create anonymous internal reporting system. Required features: (1) anonymity protection, (2) monthly status updates to whistleblower on investigation and actions taken. Creates internal escalation path before external reporting.</span></span></span></p>

            <p><span class="annotation obligation">(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the disclosures and responses of the process required by this subdivision <strong>shall be shared</strong> with officers and directors of the large frontier developer at least once each quarter.<span class="annotation-tooltip">OBLIGATION: Internal whistleblower reports must reach top leadership (officers/directors) quarterly. Ensures board-level awareness of safety concerns.</span></span></span></p>

            <p><span class="annotation exception">(B) If a covered employee has alleged wrongdoing by an officer or director of the large frontier developer in a disclosure or response, subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to that officer or director.<span class="annotation-tooltip">EXCEPTION: If whistleblower alleges wrongdoing by specific officer/director, that person doesn't receive the report. Prevents retaliation and conflicts of interest.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>(f) <span class="annotation enforcement">The court is authorized to award reasonable attorney's fees to a plaintiff who brings a successful action for a violation of this section.<span class="annotation-tooltip">ENFORCEMENT: Fee-shifting for successful whistleblower plaintiffs. Makes it economically viable to bring retaliation claims. Deters violations.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>(g) <span class="annotation enforcement">In a civil action brought pursuant to this section, once it has been demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that an activity proscribed by this section was a contributing factor in the alleged prohibited action against the covered employee, the frontier developer <strong>shall have the burden of proof</strong> to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged action would have occurred for legitimate, independent reasons even if the covered employee had not engaged in activities protected by this section.<span class="annotation-tooltip">ENFORCEMENT: Burden-shifting in retaliation cases. Once employee shows whistleblowing was "a contributing factor" in adverse action (preponderance standard), employer must prove by clear and convincing evidence they would have taken action anyway for legitimate reasons. Protects whistleblowers.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>(h) <span class="annotation enforcement">In a civil action or administrative proceeding brought pursuant to this section, a covered employee may petition the superior court for appropriate temporary or preliminary injunctive relief. An order authorizing temporary injunctive relief shall remain in effect until an administrative or judicial determination has been issued. In addition to any harm resulting directly from a violation of this section, the court shall consider the chilling effect on other covered employees asserting their rights under this section in determining whether temporary injunctive relief is just and proper.<span class="annotation-tooltip">ENFORCEMENT: Whistleblowers can get preliminary injunctions (e.g., reinstatement pending trial). Court must consider chilling effect on other potential whistleblowers. Provides immediate relief before full trial.</span></span></span></p>

            <div class="section-title">SECTION 5. General Provisions</div>

            <p>(f) <span class="annotation scope">This act <strong>preempts</strong> any rule, regulation, code, ordinance, or other law adopted by a city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency on or after January 1, 2025, specifically related to the regulation of frontier developers with respect to their management of catastrophic risk.<span class="annotation-tooltip">SCOPE: State preemption of local laws. Cities/counties cannot regulate frontier developers' catastrophic risk management. Creates uniform statewide standard. Only applies to local laws adopted on/after Jan 1, 2025.</span></span></span></p>
